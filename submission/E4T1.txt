# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable SSH password login on Web Service Instance - C3. Use private key authentication instead
- Restrict internet access only to specific IP address ranges. Place Web Service Instance in private subnet.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Use least privilege access as needs: modify c3-app-InstanceRole IAM role to grant access only to the free recipes bucket
- Use default server-side encryption for S3 bucket using AWS managed key (SSE-S3)
- Use Customer Master Keys (CMKs) stored in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for server-side encryption for S3 bucket
