# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Place Web Service Instance into private subnet
- Make Web Service Instance to connect to S3 bucket via private VPC endpoints.
- Add WAF to filter/block undesirable traffic from the Internet.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Creating private VPC endpoints for the S3 would prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket only if that bucket would be additionaly properly hardened.
And do allow access to it via these private VPC endpoints only from specific private IP address, private CIDR range or from the secure and trusted sources.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. The existing objects won't be encrypted. but, new objects will be encypted as well.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All the changes would be overridden. The EC2 instances, Security Groups, S3 buckets will be reverted to initial state.
