Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web Service instance should be in private subnet to ensure private access only instead of public access
# Poor practice 2
WebAppSG should only allow access from ALB to Web Service instance on port 5000
# Poor practice 3
Client can request web app thru HTTP instead of secure protocal HTTPS
