2. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 on port 3389
3. Recipe Web Service instance doesn't need to have a public IPv4 address
4. S3 buckets should enable server-side encryption
5. ALB should enable HTTPS protocol, and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
6. WebAppSG SSH should restrict traffic from 0.0.0.0./0
7. On Web Service Instance - C3, UDP security ports (20, 21, 23, 137, 138, 389, 445,...) should not reachable 
8. On Web Service Instance - C3, TCP security ports (20, 21, 23, 137, 138, 389, 445,...) should not reachable 

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
